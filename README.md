# HasuraFilestore

I've split my Working Project into modules and handling each component ( esp, if something unknown to me). 

This Module is to,

1. Login a default user. 
2. Request user permission to write into extStorage.
3. ACTION_PICK for audio/mp3 files and get the file URI
4. Parse that and get the filePath.
5. Create a new file with the path 
6. Upload that to Filestore.
